# Understanding Realm (CRUD Operations) 

## Description:
MongoDB Realm Project
Description
This project is designed to help you understand MongoDB Realm, a powerful tool for modern mobile application development. The Realm Mobile Database is a fast and scalable alternative to SQLite, simplifying data storage, querying, and synchronization in mobile applications. It offers an object-oriented data model, allowing developers to work directly with native objects without the need for ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) or DAOs (Data Access Objects).

## Key Features:
This project focuses on the following key features:

Create Operation: Learn how to create and add data to your MongoDB Realm database. This operation is fundamental to building any data-driven application.

Read Operation: Understand how to retrieve and query data from your MongoDB Realm database. Reading data is a crucial part of many mobile applications.

Delete Operation: Explore how to remove data from your MongoDB Realm database. Deleting data can help keep your database clean and up-to-date.

Update Operation (can also be implemented): Although not explicitly mentioned in the project description, you can implement an update operation to modify existing data in your database. This operation is essential for maintaining and managing data in your application.
